# Data-Science-URegina
During my postdoc at the University of Regina, We started a Machine Learning group. This came about because a lot of us were working
on projects that used machine learning and other data science techniques in generat. In this repository, I will add some of the 
things I do for the group. Each of the notebook added will be deacribed here. Most of them will be talks or training sessions that I
facilitate as well as problems of the week.
